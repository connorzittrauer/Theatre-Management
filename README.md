# Theatre-Management
This was a final project for CSC 315.

A JavaFX interface was used to mock a theatre management system.
Tickets were inserted through a POS system to a MySQL database and Java was used to dynamically render JavaFX 
UI components for listing invoices and current films.

The MySQL database was normalized to 3N5 and a master script was used to insert rows.
